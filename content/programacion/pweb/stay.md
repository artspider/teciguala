In times like these where our everyday life is pausing and we’re trying to find strategies to cope with this situation we all find ourselves in at the moment, little routines can help give us a sense of security and familiarity — no matter if it’s having a cup of coffee in the midday sun on your balcony, calling an old friend in the evenings, or trying out a new recipe every day.

One of our routines here at Smashing that has been going on for more than nine years already and that we’re continuing now, too, of course, is to provide you with new wallpapers every month. So if you need a little bit of colorful inspiration or something to cheer you up this April, we’ve got you covered.

Designed with love by artists and designers from across the globe, the wallpapers in this collection come in versions with and without a calendar for April 2020. As a little bonus goodie, we also compiled some wallpaper favorites from the past at the end of this post — after all, some things are just too good to be forgotten. A big thank you to everyone who shared their artworks with us this month! Enjoy and take care!
