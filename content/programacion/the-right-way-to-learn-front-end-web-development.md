## The right way to learn front-end web development

Web Development is a field that is probably not going anywhere in the next 5-10-15 years. This strong assumption comes with the facts about how quick web is moving, the improvements in hardware people have with them (fast and smart mobile phones), and cloud-based applications which allows to do the heavy lifting in the cloud and use the browser as a bridge to connect powerful backend servers with less capable and powerful frontends. This makes it the best bet to learn web development right now if you're looking to learn something.

Not only would it open a plethora of opportunities for you as an individual, but you'll also be able to code and deploy complete projects end-to-end which can be consumed by almost everyone on the planet. Since most people have browsers with them anyway, every person is just a single URL away from your web-app and something you've coded - compare this with a desktop application or a hardware-based product. It's just not that scalable compared to the web. Alright! Now that we've established the fact that the web is the best way to go about right now if you want to learn something, let's see how to learn web development.

## The web is vast - start small and keep it small

You would've seen a huge amount of available JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue, Ember, jQuery, XYZ, etc. Some very common questions I get as a YouTuber posting web development content is on the following lines:

Should I learn X?

Is X better than Y?

What is the scope of Z?

Always remember 2 things about technology, especially about the web:

1. Your tech stack almost always never matters. If you're good enough with your language/framework, you'll win every time.
2. You never need to learn everything. Never. Be a jack of all, and surely master of one.

To summarize this section, you need to think very small when you start, as it is super easy to get carried away with that hot framework in the market or trying to race ahead by dropping old tech and adapting new tech without doing proper research.

## Conclusion

In today's world, it's so easy to not repeat the mistakes I did while learning web development myself, because all those mistakes are now public for everyone to read! You have so many resources and I've myself been working on one for web developers to learn! Here's my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/codedamn) where I teach how to program awesome things and here's the [codedamn platform](https://codedamn.com/) - the actual platform which allows you to become a great developer by blending a bunch of videos, articles, and exercises! Let me know what you think about this article, and web development in general, through my [twitter](https://twitter.com/mehulmpt) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mehulmpt) handles. I would love to connect with you out there!

Peace!
